# React-athon


For this hackathon we were tasked with using everything that we have learnt to build a React app.
Our first job was to choose an API to use, this was trickier than it first sounded as we found that a lot of the APIs either didn't work properly or at all, or that they didn't have information that we felt like we could use.

Next, we were to ideate and plan, going through the full Disney ideation process, refining our MVP and deciding on stretch goals. We also broke down each task, ordered them and assigned timings, to help us organise and plan the day.

After that, we started to build component trees, thinking about where we anticipated passing props and where states would be used. This was incredibly helpful and saved us a lot of time during the build.

Next, we started to build. We built a cat collector app, it displayed different breeds of cats, you could favourite and keep the cat in a small card at the bottom, move onto the next cat or reset your collection. We even had time to style our app.

Finally, it was time to retro, we talked about what had gone well, what hadn't gone too well and what we would do next time and then planned and presented our app to the group.

I learnt a lot during this build. I realised how much I have learnt through the course of the bootcamp and solidified my knowledge of props and states. This was also the first time we had been asked to go through the whole design process and build an app in only a day.

I am really pleased with how well we did and how much we got done.
